Thank you for your inquiry regarding statistical support services for your proposal entitled "Nothing Every Day: An Inquiry into the Habits of Pooh Bears". \bigskip

As a fictional character from A. A. Milne's Winnie-the-Pooh books, I am your closest friend amongst all the toys and animals featured in the stories. Although I am a "very small animal" of a generally timid disposition, I will endeavor to be brave and on occastion conquer my fears in support of your big proposal.
